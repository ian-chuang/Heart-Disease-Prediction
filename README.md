# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for the ECS171 group project focused on developing a predictive model for assessing the likelihood of heart disease. The project involves exploratory analysis of a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) to gain insights into the data. Various machine learning models have been implemented and tested, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Categorical Naive Bayes
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Neural Network

The neural network model is fine-tuned using techniques such as K-Fold Cross Validation and Grid Search to optimize its performance.
